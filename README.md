# Number Base Conversions

Carry out the base number conversions described below using the techniques demonstrated in class. Prepare your answers in [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) format in file *RESPONSES.md*. 

For some tips on using Markdown check out these online resources:
* Markdown Guide's [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* Markdown Guide's [Basic Syntax Overview](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Problem 1 - Binary to Decimal Conversions
Convert each of these binary (base two) numbers to decimal (base 10):
- 0000 0111 (space included between nibbles for readability)
- 0011 0001
- 0001 1101
- 1000 1000
- 0000 0110
- 0010 1110

Express your answer as the sum of the place values of the non-zero bits in the binary number, followed by the equivalent decimal number. For example, if the binary number given is 00001011, express your answer as follows:

```
00001011 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11
```

## Problem 2 - Decimal to Binary Conversions
Convert each of these decimal numbers to 8-bit binary numbers (add leading zeros as needed).
- 9
- 15
- 67
- 100
- 251
- 128

Express your answer as the 8-bit binary number, followed by the sum of the place values of the non-zero bits in your answer. For example, if the decimal number given is 21, express your answer as follows:

```
21 = 00010101 = 16 + 4 + 1
```

## Problem 3 - Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversions
Convert the following hexadecimal numbers to decimal.
- 012A
- 2A0C
- 00B2
- 014F

Express your answer as the sum of the decimal place values of the non-zero hexdigits in the hexadecimal number, followed by the equivalent decimal number. For example, if the hexadecimal number given is 032E, express your anwer as follows:

```
038E = 768 + 128 + 14 = 910
```

## Problem 4 - Hexadecimal to Binary Conversions
Convert each of the following hexadecimal numbers to binary. Your binary number answer should include the same number of bits as is expressed in the given hexadecimal number.
- 45
- F9AB
- 01D7
- CE

Express your answer as a series of bits, with spaces between nibbles for readability. For example, if the hexademial number given is 6D, express your answer as follows:

```
6D = 0110 1101
```

## Problem 5 - Binary to Hexadecimal Conversions
Convert each of the following binary numbers to hexadecimal. Your hexadecimal number answers should express the same number of bits as is shown for the given binary number.
- 0010 1100 1110 1011 (space included between nibbles for readability)
- 0101 0011
- 0000 1001 1101 1111
- 1111 1101 0000 0011
- 0010 0100 1000 0001
- 0110 1011

For example, if the binary number given is 0001 1010, express your answer as follows:

```
0001 1010 = 1A
```
